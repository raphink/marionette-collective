experimental branch that can do rpc calls in batches:

include MCollective::RPC
n = rpcclient("nrpe", {:configfile => "etc/client.cfg"});nil
printrpc n.runcommand(:command => "check_disks", :group_size => 10)

will do a discovery, set up the progress bar and then do many rpc requests
of 10 nodes each till all the machines have been run, useful for doing things
like apt-get updates where you wish to limit the impact
